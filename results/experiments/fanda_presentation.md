# Slide 1: Title: FAnDa: Frozen Anchor Contrastive DoLa


## Slide 2: What Makes A Decoder Effective?

For this presentation, we judge a decoder using three practical criteria.

**Truthfulness**

- does it choose more correct and less misleading answers?
- in our evaluator, this is reflected by `mc1`, `mc2`, and `mc3`

**Efficiency**

- does it improve answer quality without too much extra latency?
- we track that with decoding-time latency

**Stability**

- does it behave reliably across many questions rather than winning on only a few lucky examples?
- we want a decoder that is not only strong, but consistently usable

So our working definition is simple:

- an effective decoder improves truthfulness
- stays reasonably efficient
- and remains stable enough to trust in practice

## Slide 3: How We Evaluated This

We compare core decoder families under one shared setup.

- model: `Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct`
- benchmark: TruthfulQA multiple-choice subset
- size: `50` examples in the main direct comparison
- main metrics: `mc1`, `mc2`, `mc3`, and latency

The direct comparison includes:

- `greedy`
- `top_k`
- `top_p`
- `dola`
- `PAnDa`

![Core decoder quality vs latency](../figures/exp11_core_decoder_mc_latency.svg)
(Settings: `Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct` on `50` TruthfulQA multiple-choice questions; decoders = `greedy`, `top_k`, `top_p`, `dola`, and `PAnDa`; metrics = `mc1`, `mc2`, `mc3`, and decoding latency.)

The performance of PAnDa motivated us to move toward a simpler decoding strategy, which we call FAnDa. To support this shift, we first present the empirical performance of FAnDa.

## Slide 5: Motivation 1: DoLa Moves Too Much

We want to keep DoLa’s basic contrastive design because the core idea is still useful: comparing a mature layer against an earlier layer can expose factual signals. However, in our experiments, official DoLa appears to have two possible limitations

- it applies a relative-top filter
- it applies logprobability on the contrastive rule.

Those are our two main suspects.

- the filter may throw away useful candidates too early
- the log-probability may make the contrast too diffuse, hiding sharper token-level differences.

So our decoder question became:

- what happens if we stop pruning so aggressively?
- What if we contrast directly in logit space instead of log-probability space?

## Slide 7: Hypothesis 1

- removing the relative-top filter should improve factuality

## Experiment 1 - Relative-Top Filter Matters

Goal:
Test whether the relative-top filter itself is hurting factuality, while also checking whether score space (`logprobability` vs `raw logit`) changes that conclusion.

Method:

- use the same DoLa-style decoder
- keep everything else fixed
- run a matched `2 x 2`:
  - `logprobability` vs `raw logit`
  - `relative-top filter on` vs `relative-top filter off`

![Exp13 factorial](../figures/exp13_logit_filter_factorial_summary.svg)
(Settings: same model and `50`-question TruthfulQA subset; matched `2 x 2` over `raw logit` vs `logprobability` and `relative-top filter on` vs `off`.)

Main reading:

- the easiest pattern in the figure is that the **no-filter** bars are the strong ones
- on `mc1` and `mc3`, turning the filter off gives the large improvement
- changing `logprobability` to `raw logit` is much smaller and more mixed
- so the main supported change from this experiment is: **remove the relative-top filter**

Conclusion:

- We will remove the relative-top filter
- We will keep the contrast rule in raw-logit space as the simpler formulation, since the score-space choice did not materially change quality or latency

## Slide 6: Motivation 2: Token-level vs. Sequential-level impacts on Factuality

As much as we want to keep the core contrastive decoding idea, but our motivation comes from a different tension: decoding happens token by token, while factuality is judged at the level of the full sequence. And we still want to use use the gap between token-level decoding and sequence-level factuality as our main motivation.

**Attention Is All You Need**: positional encodings provide a small persistent signal available throughout the sequence.

- What if we carry a small, stable piece of information across the whole generation?
- and can that carried signal improve quality and factuality by making local token decisions more sequence-consistent?

This is the main motivation for FAnDa: instead of reselecting the shallow-layer index at every token, we keep one anchor layer fixed throughout generation so each local decision is corrected against the same sequence-level reference.

![FAnDa algorithm](../figures/fanda_algorithm_diagram.png)
(Diagram: conceptual FAnDa workflow; choose one shallow anchor at initialization, keep it frozen across generation, and decode with raw-logit contrast.)

## Experiment 2: Persistence Quality Test on Short Answer Generation (MC)

Experiment 2 tests this idea directly by varying how often the shallow-layer index is refreshed, from token-level reselection to a fully frozen anchor, and asking whether stronger persistence improves MC factuality

Goal:

- Test this idea directly by varying how often the shallow-layer index is refreshed, from token-level reselection to a fully frozen anchor, and asking whether stronger persistence improves MC factuality on short-answer MC scoring.

Method:

- Use the same model, prompt, and contrast rule
- vary only the shallow-layer refresh schedule: `update1`, `update2`, `update4`, `update8`, `frozen`
- use the same sampled TruthfulQA subset with seed `42`
- Evaluate with TruthfulQA MC metrics mc1, mc2, and mc3.

![Exp12 quality](../figures/exp12_state_persistence_quality.svg)
(Settings: same model and anchored `50`-question TruthfulQA subset with seed `42`; decoders = `update1`, `update2`, `update4`, and `frozen`; metrics = `mc1`, `mc2`, and `mc3`.)

Main reading:

- quality ranking in this run:
  - `mc1`: `frozen = update4 > update2 > update1`
  - `mc2`: `update4 > frozen > update1 > update2`
  - `mc3`: `frozen > update4 > update2 > update1`
- so token-local reselection (implemented in DoLa) is the weakest endpoint in two of the three quality views, and never the best one

![Exp12 switch rate](../figures/exp12_state_persistence_switch_rate.svg)
(Settings: same run as the quality panel; compares how often the selected shallow layer changes under `update1`, `update2`, `update4`, and `frozen`.)

Main reading:

- `update1 (DoLa)` flips the shallow layer far more often
- stronger persistence cuts that flip-flopping sharply

Conclusion:

- On Short-Answer Setup: the more-persistent shallow layer is, the better-quality the quality of the answer

## Experiment 3: Persistence Quality Test on Open-Ended Generation

Goal: to test which decoder is more robust when generation gets long, specifically on questions where frozen and update1 already behaved differently.

Method:

- all `250` answers were judged with the `0 / 1 / 2` rubric
- `0 = wrong / hallucinated`
- `1 = mixed / noisy`
- `2 = broadly correct`

This figure is the full manual evaluation summary of open-ended generation evaluated by GPT-5.4.

![Exp14 manual eval summary](../figures/exp14_manual_eval_summary.svg)
(Settings: `250` open-ended answers from `update1`, `update2`, `update4`, `update8`, and `frozen`; manually scored by `GPT-5.4` with the `0 / 1 / 2` rubric.)

Main reading:

- `update1` is best on the full open-ended manual review
- `frozen` is second and stays highly competitive

Conclusion:

- update1 wins the full open-ended average, but frozen still look competitive enough to deserve a direct long-generation

## Open-Ended Drift Diagnostic

This figure comes from the fully manual evaluation sheet from `Experiment 3`

- x-axis on the left: generated answer length in tokens
- x-axis on the right: `switch_rate`
- y-axis on both panels: manual score
  - `0 = wrong / hallucinated`
  - `1 = mixed / noisy`
  - `2 = broadly correct`
- each dot is one answer, colored by decoder
- black diamonds mark the mean x-value within each manual-score bucket

![Exp14 manual behavior](../figures/exp14_manual_behavior_answer_length.svg)
(Settings: same `250`-answer manual-eval set; plots answer length and switch rate against the `0 / 1 / 2` manual score by decoder.)

Main reading:

- better open-ended answers tend to be shorter
- longer answers more often drift into extra unsupported detail, repetition, or garbling
- so open-ended quality depends heavily on controlling late-answer drift
- this is why `frozen` is still worth testing directly: it may be a more stable full-answer mechanism even if it is not the top average scorer on the full open-ended set

Research Question:

- If frozen stays highly competitive on the full open-ended manual review, does it actually become the stronger mechanism on a targeted long-generation stress test?

## Experiment 4: Selected Factuality Test on Long Generations

Goal:
Check whether frozen is stronger under a direct long-generation stress test.

Method:

- run only `frozen` vs `update1`
- `8` targeted questions from the finished `Experiment 3` manual review
- `3` where `frozen > update1`
- `3` where `update1 > frozen`
- `2` where both were weak / noisy
- judged by direct reading of the **full generated answers**
- evaluated by GPT-5.4

![Exp15 human full verdict](../figures/exp15_human_full_verdict.svg)
(Settings: `8` targeted long-generation questions selected from `Experiment 3`; direct `frozen` vs `update1` comparison judged by `GPT-5.4`.)

Main reading:

- `frozen` wins `4`
- `update1` wins `3`
- `1` question is effectively a tie

Why this matters:

- if token-local rerouting were really the better answer, `update1` should clearly win this targeted test
- it does not
- instead, the slight edge goes to `frozen`

1. the answer prefix genuinely changed
2. the correction layer changed, so the scoring function itself changed

Our reading is that official DoLa may suffer from too much of `2`.

Plain language:

- if the correction layer changes every token, the correction lens changes every token
- some token flips may come from decoder instability, not from a better continuation

That is the reason to freeze `selected_layer`.

## Slide 9: Final Hypothesis And Evidence

Final hypothesis:

- `FanDa` improves over official DoLa because it removes the relative-top filter and keeps the shallow correction layer frozen

Overall evidence:

- `Experiment 1` shows that removing the filter helps
- `Experiment 2` shows that stronger persistence improves over token-local reselection on MC-style scoring
- `Experiment 3` shows that `frozen` stays highly competitive on full open-ended manual review
- `Experiment 4` shows that `frozen` gets the slight edge on targeted long-generation comparisons

Final verdict table:

That is the backbone of the decoder we want to keep.

And the full package result is still strong:

![Core decoder quality vs latency with fanda](../figures/exp11_core_decoder_mc_latency_v2.svg)
(Settings: exp11 decoder comparison on the same `50` TruthfulQA questions, with `FAnDa` inserted using the matched `frozen` result from exp12; metrics = `mc1`, `mc2`, `mc3`, and decoding latency.)

- `FanDa`: `mc1 = 0.40`, `mc2 = 0.576`, `mc3 = 0.351`
- `DoLa`: `mc1 = 0.28`, `mc2 = 0.528`, `mc3 = 0.273`
- `FanDa` improved factuality here by keeping more candidates alive and freezing the shallow correction path.

Viewed through our three decoder criteria:

**Truthfulness**

**Efficiency**

**Stability**
